## README

This is the repository that contains my Milestone Report for the Data Science Capstone course by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. 

In this document I explain the major features of the training data, which comes from a corpus called HC Corpora and were collected from publicly available sources by a web crawler. At the end of the document, I briefly summarize my plans for creating the prediction algorithm in a Shiny application.

The document were publised in Rpubs and can be accessed [here](https://rpubs.com/Karl83/851306).

This repository contains the following codes:

1. The file "MilestoneReport.Rmd" contains the code of the report in "R Markdown format".

2. The file "MilestoneReport.md" contains the code of the report in "Markdown format". It is in a readable format.
